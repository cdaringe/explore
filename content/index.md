    <p>Check the <a href="/pages/about">about</a> page for more information on Explore OCaml and the <a href="/pages/opam">opam page</a> if you are unfamiliar with the OCaml Package Manager. Otherwise, choose the user that best matches you and explore the workflows.</p>

        <h1 class="ruled"><a href="/users/beginner">Beginners</a></h1>
        <p>If you are just getting started on learning the OCaml language, there are several resources to get you going. The beginner workflows will get you familiar with where you can find answers to common questions, find interactive playgrounds, and hook into possibly familiar learning mechanisms such as Jupyter notebooks.</p>

         <h1 class="ruled"><a href="/users/application-developers">Application Developers</a></h1>
        <p> If you have found an OCaml application that you want to work on and extend, then read on about the Application Developer workflows. This will get you started with a build environment and all the dependencies you need to build the application within a modern IDE.</p>

        <h1 class="ruled"><a href="/users/distribution-manager">Distribution Managers</a></h1>
        <p>If you are maintaining OCaml on a particular operating system, you will be juggling the various quirks of OCaml applications and libraries with hundreds of other programming languages and build systems. The Distribution Manager workflows collect tools that operate over the opam repository metadata and provide mechanisms to programmatically translate them to your own distribution.</p>

        <h1 class="ruled"><a href="/users/teacher">Teachers</a></h1>
        <p>If you are teaching OCaml to a class, then you will need to support the installation of the tools on a variety of platforms, and hook into grading systems. The teaching workflows will cover that, and also link to projects that exist to support your efforts.</p>

        <h1 class="ruled"><a href="/users/library-author">Library Authors</a></h1>
        <p>If you want to break up your application into reusable chunks, then you will create OCaml libraries. As a Library Author, you will learn how to partition your source code into multiple libraries, to write unit tests and documentation, to apply auto-formatting, and eventually publish them publicly to the central opam repository.</p>

        <h1 class="ruled"><a href="/users/end-user">End Users</a></h1>
        <p> If you are an End User that simply wants to install an OCaml application as fast as possible on your platform, read on about how to do that. Beyond the standard opam client, there are also several domain-specific ones that may be more useful to you, such as the opam2nix binary distributor or the esy client that supports npm-like description files.</p>
