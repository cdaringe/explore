<h1 id="Explore-OCaml">Explore OCaml</h1>

<p>One of the biggest problems programming languages face in a real world setting is that getting started with them isn&#39;t necessarily easy. OCaml is no exception. There tend to be lots of great resources explaining interesting aspects of the language like GADTs or the module system - but not as many centred around productivity workflows i.e. getting things done in OCaml.</p>
<p>Often these workflows are obvious... once you know them. Explore OCaml is a centralised source for workflows in OCaml categorised by user, tools and libraries with rich linking to external sources of information.</p>
<p><hr/>Here are some of the common problems users face:</p>
<ol><li>I&#39;m running the <code>ABC</code> operating system, how do I get started with OCaml? (In particular the Windows experience).</li><li>I want to build a library that does <code>X</code>, what is the best workflow* for achieving this?</li><li>I just want to run some <em>Hello-World</em> examples and get started with OCaml - how do I do this? (similar to 1)</li><li>I&#39;ve noticed a bug in library <code>Y</code> - how do I fix it and contribute to the original library?</li><li>OCaml seems to have many backends - <em>x86, ARM, RISC-V, JavaScript</em> - but how do I use them?</li><li>There is a cool tool written in OCaml - how do I install and use it? </li><li>I&#39;m running on OS <code>ABC</code> but want to compile for <code>XYZ</code> - can I do that in OCaml?</li></ol>

<p>**workflow: this involves testing, publishing, formatting, building etc. all of the common tooling that needs to be in place to allow most programming languages to solve real world problems.*</p>
<p>This site aims to answer these questions for you, as well as let you discover more advanced workflows as your use of OCaml grows. First, we&#39;ll introduce the only essential tool you need â€” opam.</p>
